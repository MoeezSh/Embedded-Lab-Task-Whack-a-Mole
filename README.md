# Embedded-Lab-Task-Whack-a-Mole
In this project, we implement 9 LEDs in 3x3 grid with coresponding buttons to push when these LEDs light up. In this Arduino based game, 
LEDs will randomly light up through an algorithm implemented. When a correct button is pushed, player gets a point. There are 3 levels or difficulty stages,
which can be set by a push button.
