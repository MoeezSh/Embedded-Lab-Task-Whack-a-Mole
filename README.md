# Embedded-Lab-Task-Whack-a-Mole

In this project, we develop an Arduino-based Whack-A-Mole-like game using LEDs. Connect a 3x3 grid of LEDs to the Arduino. When the game starts, the LEDs should light up randomly for a given duration. When the mole-LED lights up, the player has to press a button to hit the mole. The results are shown on a serial monitor.
